# rotatepdf
This is a python script to rotate pdf files. It is run through the command line and can process multiple files that has to be rotated the same way.

## Setup:
To run this script you have to make sure you have the requirements installed. These modules can be installed from the requirements.txt file by running:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
## Use:
To rotate your .pdf-files with this script put your pdf files into the input folder and run the script with:
    
    python rotatepdf.py
    
Next you input how many degrees clockwise you want your files to be rotated.

## Planned features:
It is my goal to make the script take input and output arguments when rotating a single file. The current folder structure should still be useable, just under a -b --batch flag.
